      <h5>Wi-Fi QR Cross-Stitch</h5>
      <img src="http://www.placekitten.com/300/200">
      <p>One of my favorite projects is a QR cross-stitch! In particular, whenever I change my Wi-Fi network name or password, I like to make a QR cross-stitch that is beautiful and decorative, and that people can scan to join the network. This time, I took a few pictures along the way to make it easier to explain what I did.</p>

      <h5>So what the heck is QR?</h5>
      <p>
        QR stands for "quick read." QR codes are two-dimensional barcodes that can be read by any number of apps. They can contain significantly more information than the traditional barcode you might find on your groceries at the supermarket. Traditionally, they are composed of black squares on a white background. They can also sustain a lot of degradation before you lose the data they are communicating; theoretically, QR codes can sustain up to anywhere from 10-30% of structural damage and still function. Designers often take advantage of this feature to make them more beautiful--adding logos, turning the squares into circles or hearts, all sorts of things.
      </p>

      <p>
        This makes them ideal for cross-stitching! Each square in the QR code is transformed into a stitch.

      <h5>But what the heck is cross-stitch?</h5>
      <p>
        Counted cross-stitch is a form of counted thread embroidery. It is very similar to needlepoint, but it is not quite the same. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Cross-stitching is often done on Aida cloth, a form of canvas that has a grid of evenly spaced holes across it. Crafters get patterns and count the position in the Aida cloth to make the appropriate stitch in the right place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine a square framed by four holes. Lower-left hole is A, upper-left is B, upper-right is C, and lower-right is D. To make a stitch, I start from the back of my work and go through hole A. Then, I punch in to hole C, making a diagonal stitch from hole A on the lower left to hole C in the upper right. Then, from the back of the work, I go through hole D, and then stitch into hole B, making a diagonal stitch from hole D in the lower right to hole B in the upper left, crossing over the stitch we made previously. Each X is a stitch. That's counted cross-stitch! If I'm making a row of stitches, I might do all of the left-to-right half-stitches before coming back and finishing them.

      <p>
        This is a strange and confusing thing to describe in text, but there are a lot of great videos out there showing it in action.
